The skincare industry is evolving with a focus on personalized solutions. The innovative Skin Care Recommendation System (SCRS) integrates skin type analysis, personalized routines, and expert insights.

Using machine learning and user data, the SCRS offers tailored skincare routines for issues like acne, aging, sensitivity, and hyperpigmentation. Users input their skin type and concerns to receive customized regimens.

The platform simplifies managing routines and product inventory, tracking progress, setting reminders, and discovering alternative products. Users can purchase recommended products directly and get detailed ingredient explanations, empowering informed skincare choices.
